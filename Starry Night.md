### Inspiration

I was inspired by Van Gogh's work *Starry Night* and created an interactive Starry Night interface based on three.js. I'm fascinated by the dynamic world this painting creates with its static brushstrokes, so I hope to use what I've learned this semester to create a truly dynamic animation.

### What I've done

I tried to construct a dynamic night of stars and moons by moving geometric, flat shapes. All the modules in the picture are in regular motion and I have set for some of them stars, planets and halos their correlation with the position of the coordinates of the mouse. So when the visitor moves the mouse, they will be able to feel the shifts in the movement of the planetary positions, in contrast to the various halos and planets that are set in regular motion.

 

### Each Part

The light coloured circles of light rotating behind represent flowing rivers of stars and wind, they will rotate while moving along the y-axis as the mouse transforms and will also go back and forth on the z-axis depending on time to achieve an in-flow effect.

The part of the sky that doesn't move with the mouse will slowly slide down out of sight over time, creating a final effect of falling stars.

The villages on the ground rise and fall over time, as if they were alive.

 

### Background music

I added Achille-Claude Debussy's piano piece *clair de lune* as background music for this interactive animation because I felt that the moonlight was very shiny in the original work, but I didn't want to go with something too loud. So I chose Achille-Claude Debussy's *clair de lune* and added the sound of the waves and birds to create the mood for the scene. It is hoped that the sound of the waves and birds will break the psychedelic and calm nature of the painting's dark tones and give a sense of the infinite life contained within.

 

### Resources used

This project is based on my Week 6 assignment on planetary motion ( https://mimicproject.com/code/e37d69db-71c4-e1a4-c8c7-f2ff838b6156 )  and was substantially modified.  I think week 6 and the subsequent lessons gave me the help I needed to realise this idea. Also, I refer to the three.js website at: https://threejs.org/

 

### Final summary

I have been working on this project since the end of last semester, and ultimately I wanted to use what I have learned this semester to bring a sense of beauty to the viewer and transport them to the mysterious moonlit night of Van Gogh. We have learnt a lot this term about building wonderful lines, geometry and they are already very beautiful when viewed on their own. And I hope to present them with an integrated sense of harmonious beauty through my assignments.
